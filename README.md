# SUPPA_supplementary_data

Supplementary data from:

"SUPPA2 provides fast, accurate, and uncertainty-aware differential splicing analysis across multiple conditions" Juan L. Trincado, Juan C. Entizne, Gerald Hysenaj, Babita Singh, Miha Skalic, David J. Elliott, Eduardo Eyras

The supplementary_data is stuctured in the following way:

  - **annotation/**: Ensembl and RefSeq files from hg19 and mm10 used for the quantification
  
  - **supplementary_data/busskamp**: Commands used and events obtained with SUPPA, analyzing 4-day time-course data for the differentiation of human iPS cells into bipolar neurons¹
  
  - **supplementary_data/erythro**: Commands used and events obtained comparing initial and final steps of differentiating human erythroblasts²
  
  - **supplementary_data/jurkat**: Commands used and events obtained in the analysis of stimulated and unstimulated Jurkat T-cells³
  
  - **supplementary_data/mouse**: Commands used and events obtained in the analyzed data from Cerebellum and Liver mouse tissues covering 8 different time points from 2 full circadian cycles⁴
  
  - **supplementary_data/simulated_reads**: Commands and files necessary for the generation of the simulated reads, with 3 replicates of control cells from Best, A. et al⁵
  
  - **supplementary_data/tra2**: Commands used and events obtained in the analysis on knockdown of TRA2A and TRA2B splicing regulators compared to controls⁵
