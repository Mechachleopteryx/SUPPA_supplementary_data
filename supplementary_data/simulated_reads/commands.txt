###3. Before running SUPPA, we need to calculate the AS events on the hg19 annotation (for RefSeq annotation, we will run with the -p option for pooling together overlapping transcripts) 
	#3.1: Generate the events: 
	python ~/suppa.py generateEvents -p -i ~/annotation/refseq_hg19.formatted.gtf -o ~/annotation/refseq_hg19.events -e SE SS MX RI FL
	#3.2: Put all the ioe events in the same file:
	awk '
	    FNR==1 && NR!=1 { while (/^seqname/) getline; }
	    1 {print}
	' ./*ioe > ./refseq_hg19.events_formatted.pooled.ioe



###4.The commands ran for SUPPA, rMATS, DEXSeq and MAJIQ are the same as for tra2/commands.txt. In this case, the two conditions are the switched vs the non_switched TRA2 files
